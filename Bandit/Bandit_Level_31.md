# Bandit Level 31

This is another git level so we start by cloning the repo

After opening the README we are output:
![080c0f58.png](../src/080c0f58.png)

First I create the file key.txt with the contents "May I come in?"

We now need to add it to our push
To do this we use the command:
> git add key.txt

however apon running we get the error message:
![a866e96e.png](../src/a866e96e.png)

We do want to add them so we add the "-f" argument to our command and this file is added

Next we need to commit out add
To do this we use the command:
> git commit -m \\<update_message>

after running this command with an appropriate message all we have left to do is push to the remote repo

To do this all we have to do is run the command:
> git push

This will push all changes we have added and commited to our remote repo

After running this command we get the output:
![1f17e188.png](../src/1f17e188.png)

Which gives us the password: 56a9bf19c63d650ce78e6ec0354ee45e
