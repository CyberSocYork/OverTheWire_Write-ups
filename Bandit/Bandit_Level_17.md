# Bandit Level 17

In this level we have two files `passwords.old` and `passwords.new` and the password is the only line that differs between the two.

For this we can use the `diff` command, which lists the differences between two text files.
> `diff passwords.old passwords.new`

The output is the line that has changed. The top is the original and the bottom is the change. The bottom one is the password: `kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd`
