# Bandit Level 27

In this level we are told there is a git repo at `ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo` and we need to clone it.

To clone a git repo we use the command `git clone`.
> `git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo`

The output of the command is as follows:

This creates a folder with the name of the repo (in this case simply `repo`) in which is the cloned repo. Inside this folder we find a file `README`. Opening this file reveals the password: `0ef186ac70e04ea33b4c1853d2526fa2`
