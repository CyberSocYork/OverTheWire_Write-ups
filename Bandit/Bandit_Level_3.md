# Bandit Level 3  
  
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory  
  
First we need to enter the **inhere** folder  
To do this we can use the command cd which stands for "change directory"  
When we use the command:  
> cd inhere  
  
Once we enter the **inhere** directory we use ls to see the files and no files are showed  
This is because the file is hidden and begins with a .  
To show these files we need to use the argument -a or --all to show all files including the hidden files  
> ls -a  
> ls --all  
  
Once we run this command we suddenly see the file ".hidden"  
  
Once we open the file we get the password: pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB
