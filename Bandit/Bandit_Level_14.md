# Bandit Level 14

In this level we are told to connect to the server `localhost` on port `30000`, and send it the current password.

We can use netcat to achieve this. The command for netcat is `nc`, and it has the syntax `nc <address> <port>`.
> `nc localhost 30000`

Once connected, we are given a text prompt where we can input data. Entering the password for the current level reveals the password: `jN2kgmIXJ6fShzhT2avhotn4Zcka6tnt`
