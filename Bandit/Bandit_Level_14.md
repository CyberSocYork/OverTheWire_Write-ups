# Bandit Level 14
In this level we are told to connect to a server and send the current password to it

The command nc which stands for netcat can be used to do this
netcat is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP

The format of nc is:
> nc \\<address> \\<port>

so this makes our command:
> nc localhost 30000

Once in we are given a text prompt where we can input data

Apon inputing the password for the current level we are given the password: BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
