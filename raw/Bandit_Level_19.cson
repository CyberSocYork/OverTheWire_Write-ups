  # Bandit Level 19
  
  In this level we are told to use the suid binary to get the password to the next level
  
  suid binarys run at an elevated level and if we run "ls -all" we will see that:
  ![2dcc4809.png](:storage/Bandit_Level_19/2dcc4809.png)
  
  This program is running as the user bandit20
  
  When we execute the binary we are greeted with this:
  ![b6916d3b.png](:storage/Bandit_Level_19/b6916d3b.png)
  
  As this program allows us to run commands as the user bandit20 there is nothing stopping us looking at  /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20 to find the password which when opened with cat gives us the password: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
